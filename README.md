# 💛 JavaScript Sample Codes

Hey there! 👋
This repo is a little **treasure chest of JavaScript examples** — from tiny code snippets to small working demos. It’s built for **learning, experimenting, and quick reference**.

Whether you’re just starting out with JavaScript or you’ve been writing code for years and want a quick refresher, this collection aims to help you see how things actually work — in small, focused examples.

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside

You’ll find simple, self-contained JavaScript samples organized by topic — things like:

* **Language basics** (variables, loops, functions)
* **DOM and browser APIs**
* **Async programming** (Promises, async/await)
* **Node.js examples** (file handling, HTTP servers)
* **Data structures & algorithms**

Each sample is written to be **easy to read and run**, with clear comments explaining what’s going on.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Here’s the general layout:

```

  ├── hello-world.js
  ├── variables-and-types.js

dom/
  ├── dom-manipulation.html
  ├── event-handling.js

async/
  ├── promises.js
  ├── async-await.js
  ├── fetch-example.js

node/
  ├── http-server.js
  ├── file-io.js

  ├── sorting/
  │   ├── bubble-sort.js
  │   ├── quick-sort.js
  ├── search/
  │   ├── binary-search.js

utils/
  ├── helpers.js
```

Some samples may include their own mini `README.md` or comments explaining what the code does.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

You only need:

* **Node.js v14+** (for Node samples)
* **A modern browser** (for DOM examples)
* Optional: **npm or yarn** if there’s a `package.json`

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrashantRatanparikhe/Javascript-Sample-Codes.git
cd Javascript-Sample-Codes
```

### Install dependencies (if applicable)

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run Samples

Run a basic JS file:

```bash
node basics/hello-world.js
```

Run a simple Node server:

```bash
node node/http-server.js
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if the sample uses that port.

For DOM examples, just open the `.html` file in your browser — no setup required.

If the repo has npm scripts:

```bash
npm run start
npm run test
```

## 🌱 Example: hello-world.js

```js
// basics/hello-world.js
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

It doesn’t get simpler than that! 😄

## 🤝 Contributing

Got a small idea, code snippet, or cool JS trick? Awesome — contributions are always welcome!

Here’s how:

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a new branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-sample
   ```
3. Add your code (and a short README or comment)
4. Keep it small and self-contained
5. Open a pull request with a short explanation

Try to follow the style of existing samples — clear, modern ES6+ syntax, and commented where it helps others understand.

---

## 🧩 Development Guidelines

* Keep examples short and focused
* Prefer readability over clever one-liners
* Use `const` and `let` (no `var` please 😅)
* Avoid extra dependencies unless necessary
* Organize code logically and use descriptive names
